Yep - This is what kinda puzzles me. If United Airlines runs a flight from Houston to Mexico City they need to have passport data for everyone on board, and they need to provide that to Mexican immigration. United also needs to confirm that everyone on their flight has the legal right to enter Mexico. If they have an Egyptian citizen they need to confirm that Egyptian has a Mexican visa before they give him a boarding pass.

It's no different than a flight to London or Toronto - Whether it's a commercial flight, a cargo flight or Taylor Swift's private jet.

International law and diplomatic agreements require countries to accept their own nationals, but no country is obligated to accept foreign nationals unless they voluntarily agree to do so through specific agreements or arrangements.

If Mexico refuses to accept non-Mexican nationals, the U.S. cannot legally force Mexico to take them without evidence of their Mexican nationality or an agreement permitting such deportations. In such cases:

Proof of Nationality: The U.S. would need to provide documentation or other evidence confirming that the individuals are indeed Mexican nationals, such as birth certificates, passports, or other records.

Negotiations with Mexico: The U.S. would need to negotiate with Mexico to accept third-country nationals, but Mexico is not obligated to do so under international law.

Alternative Deportation: If Mexico refuses and the U.S. cannot prove Mexican nationality, the U.S. would have to deport the individuals to their country of origin or another country willing to accept them.

People are getting wise on the prison labor thing, so why not switch it over into internment camp labor?

Quote:
On 30 January 1933, Adolf Hitler became chancellor after striking a backroom deal with the previous chancellor, Franz von Papen.[1] According to historian Nikolaus Wachsmann, the Nazis had no plan for concentration camps prior to their seizure of power.[2] The concentration camp system arose in the following months due to the desire to suppress tens of thousands of Nazi opponents in Germany. The Reichstag fire in February 1933 was the pretext for mass arrests; the Reichstag Fire Decree eliminated the right to personal freedom enshrined in the Weimar Constitution.[1][3] The first camp was Nohra, established in Nohra, Thuringia on 3 March 1933 in a school.[4] The arrests increased after the election of 5 March.[1]

Really?  ""No reason"" you can possibly think of?  I can think of two additional incentives: 1) economic sanctions, and 2) overwhelming crushing military action by the world's largest superpower run by an unhinged madman.

Just speaking to the 2nd one, since the US has the world's largest and most powerful military, with total and complete air superiority, the USA could absolutely ground all Mexican flights (both military and civilian). 
 So one idea is to choose an airport, take over that airport and 500 miles in every direction from that location, and drop people off there, and fly away unhindered.  What Mexico chooses to do after that is up to them?

I'm not saying that's a good idea.  It would be expensive, and not morally correct.  But it is just odd to say Mexico can ONLY be bribed and ignore how horribly bad this can go.  I don't want any surprised Pikachu faces when the USA refuses to pay Mexico bribes because it was the ""only possible outcome"".",-1

The law cited above says the next step is the Attorney General goes to the President and says â€œgee, Mexico denied or unreasonably delayed accepting their return. Seems reasonable to me, itâ€™s the same way we returned the Guatemalans.â€

The next step is â€œthe Secretary of State shall order consular officers in that foreign country to discontinue granting immigrant visas or nonimmigrant visas, or both, to citizens, subjects, nationals, and residents of that country until the Attorney General notifies the Secretary that the country has accepted the alien.â€

In other words, itâ€™s an excuse to cut off legal travel unilaterally.

Also notice:

1. Once Mexico does accept the return, whether by land, air or sea, thereâ€™s no requirement for how quickly the AG has to report that to the Secretary of State.
2. They can rinse, lather and repeat indefinitely: have a plane denied, finish the return on land, send another plane with somebody else, get denied again, and so on.",1

I would bet something akin to this happened.

Musk went to Russia and came back and jumped on Trumps wagon after building some bridges with Putin. They cheated the election with some software and assets brought back from Russia, some skilled people that work for Musk and some well timed bomb threats by the Kremlin allowed the few minutes required to compromise the machines. It may not have even been necessary actually but I bet it happened.

That's the election all done.

Then when he wins. He immediately attacks the America's three biggest trading partners. Canada, Mexico and China. Elon starts attacking Germany and Britain. Trump goes on to threaten Greenland and Denmark. This is on top of continued attacks and alienation of blue states.

So you've attacked effectively your military allies and all your trade allies. You've also alienated and othered 1/3 to 2/3rds of your own population. This is isolationism 101 and is speed running what Putin has been doing for 20 years. It's literally another Brexit, which was a glorified test run for the U.S.

Then he goes on to start gutting task forces, skilled assets and other people that operate and function a well organized government because a little bit of chaos is the desire.

That's not good enough though it needs to be permanent. Today they killed the Federal Cyber Security Group something that has been mentioned but is 1 thing in 500 shitty things that happened this week. 1 of those 500 shitty things is the Amendment adjustment to allow Trump to run for 3 terms but disallows Obama. 

Wait but doesn't Trump need like 3/4 of the States, Senate and Congress to make that amendment...isn't that being proposed just dick sucking theatre by a Republican.

Perhaps.

At the sametime it's cyber security that got eliminated and those task forces that try and help prevent foreign hacking of computers used for...elections. He's also made several of the richest people on Earth with the most skilled programmers and engineers on Earth virtue signal loyalty by bending the knee and even changing how their Billion dollar companies work with employees. They belong to him now, people who specialize in computers.

Do they now have the assets with the Presidents Office, the Senate, the Congress, 5 of 9 Supreme Court Judges, the largest fascist propaganda machine to have ever existed in all of history, 3 of the richest tech oligarch's in America, an Ex-KGB Officer and current President of a hostile nation that has fantasized about kicking America in the balls...who if rumours are to be believed has the largest aggressive black hat hacking farm in the world.

they never touch land because they went there using non land vehicles and because they never do so i doubt they would take the extra step of going to Mexico

people from there never touch the south or north sides of that country so it's not fault of neither Mexico or canada

my little story i said on main post (the one you commented first) was to point out that some people being sent to north mexico was people that never been to Mexico and do not speak any common tongue of the continent of America

just searching on Google shows me it's most common they come from cargo boats that have barely any security (as importing from these parts to the US it's very common) or are paid by the people and they come from asia or africa (not very descriptive and sorry if I'm generalizing but google isn't cooperating with actual sites with sources other than ""the experts"")

the worst part is that these people end up dying or becoming homeless as the language barrier really hurts the chance of getting a job

What's not clear to me is if these are different flights than the 3 that you're quoting that arrived in Guatemala Friday. There is some correlation, for sure, but the article isn't so clear about that. Did the flights that departed Thursday night arrive Friday, including the third originally bound for Mexico? Or were these separate flights altogether?

I've a few friends who were born in the US and ended up with citizenship, but have lived in Ireland since they were babies. Most of these people came back to Ireland during the early 2000s.     
    
A little bit of that culture still remains, with lots of Irish going I've on working holiday J1 Visas for a few months, but it wouldn't be particularly unusual for people to overstay that Visa by a little bit and continue under the radar before coming home. Looking at the overstay reports though, this would only be less than maybe 2% of people though.     
    
For an Irish person it's pretty low risk to be honest, cause many of these people have perfectly stable lives back home and are in the US to have a good time and experience the culture. If something goes wrong, they can hop on a plane at JFK and get back home without many problems. And the punishment probably isn't as bad for a European who overstays than someone from a less developed part of the world.      
    
I work in academia and there isn't anyone I know in my office who would want to actually move to the US and start a family there etc. Most people obviously want to stay in Ireland, but if they do want to leave or feel like they have to, they always seem to favour the UK, EU ( Netherlands or Scandinavia ), NZ, Australia or Canada.",7

2349,m908njx,1737763182,Poudy24,"The idea that the country of origin should reimburse the U.S. is completely nonsensical, in multiple ways.

First, what would you want the country to do? Prevent all of their citizens from leaving the country, on the off chance that some of them might decide to stay somewhere illegally? That makes no sense, and I sure would like to see your reaction if your country tried to implement such a system.

Second, when talking about migratory patterns, the responsibility is generally on the country where the migrants are trying to go. When passing a border, the agents that are going to grill you and ensure you're not carrying anything you're not supposed to aren't from the country you're departing from, but rather from the country where you're going. At the end of the day, whether you want secure borders or not, the bottom line is that it's the US's responsibility to protect their borders. Other countries shouldn't have to pay for their failure to do so. 

Third, even if something like this could be implemented, it would be stupid for the US to suggest it since it would actively make the problem worse. A major part of what drives migrants to go to the US is because their country of origin is too poor to take care of its own citizens. By putting another financial burden on these countries, you're only exacerbating the problem and will thus just create more migrants that will seek to go to the US. 

By the way, here in Canada, we get plenty of migrants illegally crossing the border from the U.S. to come here. I have no doubt a lot of them will soon be natural-born citizens that had their citizenship revoked. By international standard, they will still technically be US citizens.

I mention this because, itâ€™s that much more likely that people are migrating into Mexico from even further south, undetected by the Mexican government, with the ultimate goal to make it up to the U.S. 

Meaning, the Mexican government isnâ€™t necessarily funneling immigrants into the U.S., as you may think, but rather all this illegal immigrant stuff weâ€™re dealing with here, specifically from *other* countries, such as Cuba and Venezuela, in America is due to Mexicoâ€™s poor control of immigration. 

From Mexicoâ€™s point of view, despite their shortcomings in the process of detecting illegal migrants passing through from other countries to the U.S., itâ€™s perfectly understandable that they donâ€™t want to take all those back into their country.

The law said they can could apply for asylum, then they crossed legally.

You know who could've fix that law in 2023, the speaker of the house MAGA Mike Johnson

I'm not happy about our immigration laws.  But I lay the blame where it belongs - The Republicans.  Which was my party before the xenophobic Fascist took it over.

A little history:

In 2014 John Boehner (the then Republican speaker of the house) refused to bring the bi partisan passed Senate Immigration reform bill to the house floor so Republicans could run on immigration in 2016.

Trump won on immigration in 2016, and did nothing for two years (other than gave wealthy people like me a huge tax cut) while he held Congress and the Senate.

He again ran on immigration in 2020 but lost.

In 2024, MAGA Mike Johnson did the same thing. He refused to bring the Senate by Partisan passed (wholly conservative drafted) immigration reform bill to the floor, so Trump could run on immigration.

Trump is Lucy with the football and all of his dumb MAGA supporters are Charlie Brown.  

Guess what, Charlie, you're not going to get to kick the football this time either.  Once the performance is over, Trump will tell you all that it's going to take longer to fix immigration.

Edit: They blocked me so I canâ€™t respond. Iâ€™ll leave it here:

The commenter above said *he didnâ€™t think the holocaust could happen today* not that it is currently happening. They then went on to draw similarities to the Japanese internment camps of which there are numerous. 

But since you still arenâ€™t getting it and seem to think Iâ€™m simply uninformed about the Holocaust and a quick trip to Germany might do the trick (Iâ€™ve been Poland and seen the camps and Iâ€™ve been to Amsterdam and stood in Annâ€™s attic.) 

The actions of ICE, of targeting individuals based on perceived skin tone or ethnicity, draw concerning parallels to the discriminatory practices of the Nazi regime. Both systems have used the visible traits of specific groupsâ€”whether skin color, ethnic markers, or cultural indicatorsâ€”as a means of marginalization, detention, and dehumanization. 

During the Nazi era, Jewish people were vilified through propaganda. ICE has been accused of profiling individuals of Latin American descent, often equating darker skin or accents with â€œillegalâ€ status, which perpetuates a harmful stereotype and reinforces systemic racism. Many have been illegally detained and held for looking like Jewsâ€¦ I mean, Mexicans. 

Both scenarios also reveal a dangerous use of government power to demonize entire groups of people for political gain. Under the Nazi regime, anti-Semitic rhetoric was central to their ideology, labeling Jewish people as societal threats to justify their persecution and eventual genocide. In the context of ICE, Trump and the actual criminals have portrayed immigrants, especially those from Central and South America, as criminals or threats to national security. This narrative justifies raids, deportations, and detentions, often targeting people without clear evidence of wrongdoing. These acts not only infringe upon human rights but create a climate of fear and mistrust within the affected communities.

Finally, a troubling similarity lies in the dehumanization of individuals within these systems. The Nazis used concentration camps to detain and ultimately exterminate millions of Jews and other minorities, stripping them of their rights, dignity, and humanity. While the scale differs, ICE detention centers have been widely criticized for inhumane conditions, including overcrowding, lack of basic necessities, and family separations. Both systems rely on stripping away the individuality of the people they target, treating them as â€œproblemsâ€ to be managed rather than as human beings. This erosion of humanity paves the way for wider societal indifference to these injustices, enabling systemic abuses to continue unchecked. Death is merely the final stop. If that is the only measure you use to draw similarities you will always be confused. Sorry, babe.",17

2619,m9315br,1737810191,tacoma-tues,"Summary: If you really are from an immigrant family you should be ashamed at how selfish your position is on this issue. The expectation that others who are engaged in an experience that you share in common should be forced to endure the same struggles and hardships and equally suffer in their experience is a petty juvenile state of emotional maturity and a concerning red flag thats often seen by people with antisocial  behavioral tendencies. In other words your a toxic psychopath and nobody wants you here. Ill take 5 humble hardworking illegal immigrants that have humility and empathy in my country before id want a entitled aggrieved lil brat that pulls up the ladder and has a sanctimonious attitude about bein legally allowed to move here.

And to your question.... One of many reasons why: Probably the job they had been offered to work would have moved on to the next guy cuz they needed to hire new employees a week ago not a year and a half from now because buisness demands increase and decline unexpectedly and a large sudden increase in customers and jobs or taking on new projects requires you to immediately increase labor force to start training and get boots on site or you default on contracts/breach service agreement terms and everything you struggled and sacrificed to build with ur buisness is flushed down the toilet because of our inefficius immigration policies and the system of foreign worker admissions/entry program is the living definition of a bureaucratic chinese finger trap if you need to quickly expand labor force to meet demands. It literally is a people trap that serves no real interests or purpose but that of the bureaucracy itself. The workers are put in limbo waiting on people so they can work, the employers waiting on people to hire, this encouragea people to circumvent the entry program and resort to lying about visa purpose and overstaying or illegal border crossing. This incentivizes related criminal activity to facilitate illegal entry, increasing illegal trafficking and the number of truly dangerous people and cross border crime  using those immigrants as cover because safety in numbers and relying on volume to reduce statistical chances of being caught is a long documented well known strategy thats been seen by transnational criminal groups for literally centuries. 

This is a problem experienced by every nation on the planet. A problem that has existed longer than our nation has. Weve had a particularly sucessful past century, which means this problem will continue to increase along with prosperity. If your soo sick of living somewhere thats desirable enough that people want to move here..... 

Well nobodys forcing you to leave, and not everyone is able to say that right now so maybe u should count your blessings instead of listing your curses and consider that any hardship or struggle or expense that you experience for having immigrants here is a pathetic and laughably petty injury to claim in comparison to sacrifices by a person who literally left the only place they know leaving everything they own behind and fucking walked..... on their two feet, sometimes the length of the latin american subcontinent...... just to get to america where they know nothing not even the language, and do their time gratefully being exploited and being constantly blamed for illegal shit criminals do in any country across the planet or simply for all of the petty inconsequential minor insignificant issues we like to call problems.....",2

2880,m955rsi,1737834226,whofearsthenight,"Thank you, this is pretty close to the reply I would have left. I will also point out that it's borderline impossible to list all of the other reasons this is similar, but a few other big ones: 

The supreme court has removed basically all checks on presidential power. Republicans have shown there is no check for literally anything he will do. Today, a bill is in the house that suggests a third term, which is another sign of how far the Overton window has shifted, previously mentioning that as an idea would have ended a politician's career. On day one, immediately after taking an oath to the constitution, he flagrantly violates it by attempting to end birthright citizenship. This is another dehumanization effort, and another fascist move, the only real citizens are the ones they decide on. He pardons violent criminals who attempted to overthrow the government for him. A sieg heil is performed at his inauguration with virtually no consequence. ICE attempts to go into a school, already an egregious action, but not at a border town or even state, in Chicago. ICE rounds up actual citizens, including a veteran as part of a warrantless raid. 

And then there is this plane. Experts have already told us this would happen, and that it's basically impossible that the 20m he wants to deport will have a country that accepts them. There will be a euphemism for it, but camps will be built, and as you point out, we're already not doing that humanely. The Laken Riley act allows authority to basically skip due process. [More in Act II here for how this is going to look.](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/846/this-is-the-cake-we-baked)

And then the question is going to be what are we actually going to do with those people? With him at the helm, who equates them all to drug dealers, murderers, and rapists. Vermin. Or for a throwback, those stealing our jobs. Speaking of history, this is the exact type of language and sometimes even verbatim the same as Hitler used to describe Jews. Donald Trump has already asked to shoot protesters. He has already stated that he wants the death penalty for undocumented people who commit crimes, and he now has a system in which guilt is determined without evidence. He previously wanted to execute five innocent men even after he learned of their innocence. I'm not sure that he sees even his own children as anything much more than NPCs, so even if he weren't sending clear signals that he views these people as non-human I wouldn't trust that he'll make a humane decision.

3036,m90gm45,1737765797,LongJohnSelenium,"One thing confusing everything is 'birthright' citizenship means two different concepts, jus soli and jus sanguine, right of the land and right of blood.

Virtually every nation on earth has birthright by blood, so the child of a citizen is a citizen in almost all cases. There's some exceptions to this that mainly apply if the parent has little or no contact with a nation they have citizenship to. For example the child of a french citizen and US citizen has french and US citizenship, but if that child never leaves france and spends no time in the US, *their* child will not have US citizenship(Edit: or have to jump through some hoops to get it). 

Birthright by soil is almost completely confined to north and south america, but almost every country in north and south america had it. I believe its mainly because, once the natives died off, it was such a massive land rush trying to keep everyones borders sorted was moderately impossible so no country got around to eliminating birthright by soil yet like most old world countries had. 

Which, to be clear, most places started out with no citizenship requirements, and they evolved over time as nations themselves evolved and the concept of 'citizenship' evolved, and as time went on countries got more and more restrictive over who could move in. So birthright by soil was a thing in most places in the world at one point but its been eliminated for various reasons. 

And of course with the specific debate in the US there's a lot of people who don't like what the constitution says and are reading more restriction into it than they should, similar to how some people interpret the 2nd amendment to be more restrictive than it is.",4

Why are you acting like that's a long time? The fourteenth amendment wasn't passed until the later 1800's, so of course any legal issues wouldn't happen until that point.

The 14th was ratified in 1868, and the action that led to US v Wong Kim Ark happened in 1895. That's pretty quick, not even considering that just due to the nature of what that section of the 14th amendment entails, you're not really going to get any court cases until the people affected are no longer children.",8
3085,m91cqd9,1737777221,Herkfixer,"It's ""modern meaning"" was decided while the people who crafted the 14th amendment were still alive. The point was that until the 14th amendment, slaves weren't citizens. If they had children, their children weren't citizens. In ""modern terms"", they were illegally present (after slavery ended) and their mere presence while giving birth did not grant citizenship to their child. The SC decided that the 14th Amendment (only written 30+ years prior) intended that having a child on US soil, granted citizenship to that child as long as the parents were subject to the laws and Constitution of the United States. Period. No equivocation. 

The reason that citizenship of the parents didn't matter was because THAT is a modern invention. Until the 1960s, one merely had to say (on documents) that they wanted to be a citizen and that was immigrating legally. 

That's why it's the height of hypocrisy when people do the whole ""my grandpappy immigrated here legally so just wait your turn and do it legally too, it's not that hard"". Well, when your grandpappy immigrated, wait your turn literally meant to get in a line at a port and walk on in.

If you have a booby trap in your home, let's say the cartoon comical ""carpet over a hole in the floor"" trick and a burglar, rapist, or even murderer falls in, they absolutely can sue you over their injuries for that. Your home is an unsafe environment and you had no signs warning about the dangers.

And none of that says that the US can just hurt or kill someone they want to deport if nobody allows them to send them away.

If you manage to capture someone breaking into your home, they are subdued and tied up in a chair, then you call the police and they say ""Great job! Unfortunately we're busy right now, we don't know when we can send someone to pick them up."", you can't suddenly shrug and decide to put a bullet in their head. That sends YOU to jail for murder.

â€œIn 1919 Adolf Hitler wrote of his desire for the complete removal of Jews from Germany, and his belief that methodical measures were needed in order to achieve that goal. By the mid-1930s, the SS had transformed that theoretical goal into a policy that called for a Germany physically â€œcleansedâ€ (Judenrein), or â€œfree of Jewsâ€ (Judenfrei). After the annexation of Austria (Anschluss) in March 1938 and even more so after the Kristallnacht pogrom of November 1938, the Nazis began pressuring Jews to emigrate.
Soon after the Germans invaded Poland in September 1939, they began implementing the first stage of deportation, by forcing Jews out of their homes and into Ghettos. There were also attempts to drive the Jews into Soviet territory. The Nazis then decided to deport all the Jews living within the Reich to an area in Polandâ€™s generalgouvernement called the Lublin Reservation. This scheme was part of the Nazisâ€™ larger plan to relocate the populations of Europe. Besides these designs for the Jews, they intended to remove many Poles from Poland, and resettle the area with ethnic Germans (Volksdeutsche), primarily from the Soviet Union. Adolf Eichmann was placed in charge of the deportations of Jews and Poles, as the SS expert on â€œJewish affairs and evacuations.â€ However, the so-called Nisko and Lublin plan faltered. Germanyâ€™s resettlement plans halted completely in mid-1941, during preparations to invade the Soviet Union. Thus, Hitlerâ€™s goal to expel all Jews from German-occupied areas had not yet been achieved.
The next stage of deportation emerged as the result of a shift in the Naziâ€™s Jewish policy from expulsion to mass extermination. After invading the Soviet Union in June 1941, the Germans began to massacre Soviet Jewry by firing squad. However, this method could not reasonably be used in the cities of Eastern and Western Europe. Thus, the Nazis decided to deport Jews to extermination centers in the East. Deportations from the Lodz Ghetto to the first extermination camp, called Chelmno, began in December 1941.â€

Australia (and many European countries) do grant citizenship if your parents are just residents, but that still excludes the children of illegal immigrants, as your parents have to be legitimate residents to qualify. This is the compromise which still allows for the principle of â€œyou were born here so can be a citizenâ€, while removing the loopholes which allow for abuse (either by illegal immigrants or by parents travelling to a country just to give birth so their child has citizenship).

Those union wages And the wealth, that those wages create (by people who are smart enough to participate in the economy by buying real estate and stocks) are the only thing standing between the middle class skilled labor and abject poverty. 

Luckily, you're about to find out - because what I know (because of my connections with my former party) is that one of the objectives of the Trump administration is to repeal that 1920s Federal prevailing wage law. 

And, since we're having a discussion about economics, (which you apparently know nothing about) in a capitalist society there are two types of economic models. One is where all the wealth goes up and pretty much stays there (this is what Maga Republicans would call trickle down economics), and the other is where the middle class is handed the portion of the profit (wealth) that the earn, and then uses that wealth to keep the economy going by growing the equities markets, and they have an opportunity to participate in those markets to grow unearned wealth for themselves and the next generation.

> The study is the first and most comprehensive analysis of the medical records of children as young as six months old and a median age of nine years old detained between June 2018 and October 2020 at Karnes County Family Residential Center in Texas â€” cited by ICE itself as the first detention facility built from the ground up with its civil detention standards in mind...

> Between 2017 and 2021, more than 650,000 children were taken into custody at the border, with more than 220,000 of these children being detained for more than 72 hours and many transferred with their families to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facilities...

The full report goes on to add

> The median length of detention was 43 days and 88 percent of children remained in detention for longer than 20 days, in violation of the terms of the Flores Settlement Agreement. 

> 4.3 percent of children exhibited moderate or severe wasting, 11.7 percent of children were â€œat risk of malnutrition,â€ 22.6 percent exhibited stunting, and 5.5 percent severe stunting. Despite this evidence, none of the childrenâ€™s medical records documented the risk of malnutrition, nor was there any indication that measures were taken to enhance the childrenâ€™s diet.

From WikipediaÂ 


After the election, von Papen urged Hindenburg to continue to rule by decree, while at the same time attempting to form a coalition with the Nazis. Negotiations failed and Papen was dismissed by Hindenburg, who replaced him with Defence minister Kurt von Schleicher.[5]


In the subsequent two months, Schleicher held talks with a faction of the Nazi Party led by Gregor Strasser in an attempt at a Querfront strategy, attempting to unite Strasserists, the SPD, the Centre Party and the trade unions.[6] The plans failed when Hitler disempowered Strasser and approached Papen for coalition talks; it is disputed if Schleicher was actually serious about his proposal.[7] Since Schleicher's ineffective rule was growing increasingly unpopular among German elites, Papen convinced Hindenburg to dismiss him and appoint Hitler as Chancellor on 30 January 1933, with a cabinet composed of NSDAP and DNVP politicians; the new government lacked a majority in the Reichstag, so a snap election was called and scheduled for March by Hindenburg.


On 27 February, the Reichstag was set on fire allegedly by Dutch council communist Marinus van der Lubbe: in response, the Reichstag Fire Decree was enacted, suspending basic liberties and allowing the Nazis to conduct mass arrests of KPD members and freely engage in paramilitary violence against their opponents.[8]


The elections were the last free and fair all-German election before the Nazi seizure of power, since the subsequent vote in March saw massive suppression against opposition politicians, especially SPD and KPD ones. The next free national elections were not held until 1949 in West Germany and 1990 in East Germany. The next free all-German elections took place in December 1990, after reunification two months earlier.",1

In a parliamentary system it is usual to not legally vote for the head of government, they are put forward by the winning party/coalition and appointed by the head of state. But that is essentially a legal technicality. It is the leader of the largest party who becomes this, everyone knows this, and it would be a huge subversion to do otherwise.Â 

Also a reminder no one ever got more than 50% of the vote in Weimar Germany. The 33% Nazis got the largest vote share anyone had got in the entire Weimar period since 1919. Multiparty systems work typically via coalition, the head of the largest party in the coalition became chancellor in Weimar Germany, would campaign on that basis, and people vote on that basis. The fact coalition talks broke down doesn't change the meaning of the vote itself.


If we take your point as true (that the Nazis / Hitler never won the vote) we have to decide that literally no one _ever_ won a federal in the Weimar republic. We also have to apply that to the myriad of multi party systems that exist to this day as well, and now a huge number of countries have elections that essentially no one ever wins.


Do you see that this starts to become ridiculous when you apply it outside this single election that makes people a little uncomfortable?

Original Quote: The Holocaust began as an attempted Mass Deportation that failed.

Clarification: the Holocaust BEGAN as a mass deportation and forced emigration attempt.

Further clarification: the infancy of the Holocaust was an attempt to intimidate Jews to leave Germany and, if they refused, to round them up into ghettos and concentration camps for later deportation. There was no plan for mass extermination at the beginning of the Holocaust.

I donâ€™t care about the â€œlargest increaseâ€ in emigration numbers. Thereâ€™s plenty of factors that can impact that, including those who refused to leave their homeland, those who lacked the paperwork to flee immediately in 1933, and those who assumed the problem wasnâ€™t that serious until the rhetoric reached a point where violence at the hands of both German civilians and institutions became commonplace.

Additionally, I think youâ€™re falling into a dangerous pitfall. Portraying Nazi Germany as inherently evil with the intent to massacre Jews on a large-scale from the beginning is incredibly reductive. It completely ignores an entire specialty of Holocaust studies that attempts to understand how regular human beings can slide into fascism and genocidal behavior.

Honestly, not trying to make a thing out of it. I think a lot of people are so used to the crazy laxness of US enforcement of immigration that they think this is normal. In the rest of the world, it's not normal. Deporting people back to their originating port of entry is the global norm. In the US it seems like the third reich has somehow taken hold and is suddenly, *gasp*, enforcing the law. 

This is how the rest of the world works. I think there's a solid argument to make that *not* doing it that way has some benefits, and the US has benefited from lax enforcement.

Your position is at like $500k right now... to make it back to $700k over 10 years all you need is 3.2% compound return not including inflation. If you include  inflation of 3%, you'd need a bit over 6% compound return to end up with over $900k ($700k in today's value) in that time frame. 

You can easily get that with just a treasury bond or even a simple fucking balanced mutual fund that pays monthly distributions that you just let reinvest... 

Maybe you need ten years of normal, not exciting gains to learn your lesson.... Honestly wtf....holding is not your only option. There are many options, including paying a fund manager their fee because they actually know more than you, and will give you boring gains(according to WSB)... additionally with the help of an accountant you can attribute these losses against future gains thus avoiding tax.  You can't do that if you just HODL.  

This fuckup means you can't afford or deserve to be worried about FOMO... IF intel rebounds. You need to recover what you lost or you'll always regret it. The toll psychologically of what this has done and may keep doing if it doesn't recover as soon as you like will be immense.

153,lg9qadv,1722672031,lisa-www,"OP, your earlier post came across my feed and I sure felt bad. Let me give you a few notes from my perspective as a former long-term Intel employee.

**Note:** This is historical. I haven't worked at Intel for many years and most of my former close colleagues have moved on or retired. But I think you might still find it helpful. 

Also, I don't usually follow this sub, it just happened to came across my feed and I had some POV to provide.

* Intel is going through a particularly bad patch right now, one of the worst but not not the only really bad patch. It is a remarkably resilient company. 
* No one follows INTC like a long-term salaried Intel employee, such as myself and my coworkers were. It was a huge part of our compensation, some people made more from stock than they did from payroll, although this varied wildly over time and based on differences in compensation packages. I watched it go down and up and down and up.
* If you look at the long-term history of INTC price going back to the 1980s, you see that the only time the share price did not fully recover from a high was the summer of 2000 when it was riding the dot-com boom to a high price it probably didn't warrant on the merits, and that it nearly returned to that price in 2021. It also has been through some legendary crashes.
* In 2006-07, Intel laid off 10k people. While that is a lower number than the current round of 15k, it was close from a percentage perspective (about 12% now vs. 10% then). 1000 managers were walked out the door in one day. A few months later, my department of 50 was cut in half. Before and since, Intel has had many rounds of RIFs, some of which became legendary. Look up the ""125% solution"" from the 1980s. Not all of their RIFs appear like publicly like layoffs. They will offer early retirement, voluntary separation buyouts, or other ways to cut workforce without actually laying people off unwillingly.
* Severe austerity measures are also not new. Perks would come and perks would go. Some years whole teams were flying to Japan for a meeting, some years almost all travel was grounded. Same ups-and-downs for food-and-beverage, office supplies, events, any form of discretionary expense. This was frustrating as employees, but what it showed was a company that knows how to be generous in perks and support when it needs to maximize employee morale and retention and can afford it, vs. times when it needs to cut costs to the bone and anyone who doesn't like it is welcome to leave.
* INTC has a weird way of not aligning with the market. This made for interesting times, when we were having layoffs and austerity measures but other companies were hiring and people quickly found new jobs... or when we were in a hiring boom while other companies were doing layoffs so we had huge candidate pools. 
* Intel is not a [dot.com](http://dot.com) or a startup with all its value on paper. It is an old company with a brand name that was once in the global top 10 and a TON of incredibly valuable property including billions of dollars in IP and hard assets. It owns huge acreages of land around the world with massive buildings, its factory equipment alone is so valuable that it won't build new fabs without making a deal with the local government to avoid property taxes. And that equipment can be valuable for a long time, because as tech moves forward it will continue to use older equipment to to make its lower-value products (yesterday's high-end pc chip is now inside a smart toaster, that sort of thing). I point this out because it would be incredibly unlikely for Intel to just disappear into bankruptcy anytime soon. It has too much to fall back on.
* Of course you know by now that the biggest lesson from all of this is to always diversify your portfolio. In fact, as employees we were advised not to purchase any additional INTC for investments or retirement because we already had so much of it through options, RSUs, ESPP, in our pension funds and company-managed 401k's... and because it was tied to our job security.

If you haven't already, I recommend reading Andy Grove's autobiography ""Only the Paranoid Survive""

So, if your plan was originally to hold the stock for ten years, you might strongly consider at least holding it for now. Will it return to the value you paid for it? Maybe not. But it from my informed opinion, it is unlikely to not go back up from where it is. As someone who has acquired and sold thousands of shares of INTC, there is no foolproof way to predict when to sell. But I don't think it's now. I still have a few shares and I am for sure holding.

But maybe at some pointâ€”not nowâ€”maybe move some of that from INTC to some other stocks. Historically, there will be times it outperforms the market, and you might want to watch for those opportunities.

Wishing you a better outcome in time.",3
154,lgav760,1722694345,WasabiDobby,Just added Intel to my robinhood watch list so everytime I open the app i can see what kinda day youâ€™re having,3
155,lgb1qw6,1722696720,SignatureCorrect2005,"i dont know how old you are but here are some tips you NEED to know.  
1. accept you lost 200k - take it as you learn a lesson that you won't do anything wild after this. there are always positive side and negative side on the market. AND even if the positive side are brighter then negative side you NEVER know what is going on cuz you are not insider of the company nor stock market.   
2. take out all the money from the stock ASAP. do not turn back and say 'i could've, or i wouldve.' its too late. it wont come back.  
3.  talk to your parents ASAP!. you need financial adviser. i bet your parents have more experience then you do. ASAP  
4. If you REALLY want to do stock, start with 1000$only . just play with it see how it goes. study with books and youtubers. see how they invest, when they sell. you will gain experience,  
5. sometimes you will feel you are dumb that you lost 200k, just think as you went to cruise and have fun with girls. just rationalize it. you cant turn it back.   
6. for your information, intel is having a serious crisis. US government won't let it sink or bankrupt intel cuz they also put many assets there. but thats 'company' side NOT stock side. at this point, people (stock broker) will short them hard. VERY hard. i think it will go down to 10$ or even lesser than 10$. you dont have to believe me but thats how the 'rumors' are going on in the market.  you dont know when stock price will go up. if you look at the MAX year how they do, 10yr ago they were 30$. it took 10yrs wobbling around that 30$ even with bubbles period. so choice is yours.

Let me tell you a secret, the only reason people were buying intel CPU's was because of ""you can't go wrong with intel"" attitude, but guess what, because of some dumb error in the intel CPU's code they have been bricking recently, and even those that haven't been bricking likelly got permanently damaged. That's a fucking nail in a coffin for intel.

Their CPUs are already shit compared to AMD, so losing that ""you can't go wrong with intel"" buyer's attitude means people (and worse, companies) will buy AMD instead. And this will be apparent in their sales and EPS in the coming years. This particular slump is an example of what's to come.

If you donâ€™t know what to invest in, I would do etfs. A mix of spy and qqq is a good start. Donâ€™t buy the higher management fees etfs they are not worth it. 

The truth is no one knows whatâ€™s gonna happen in the long term.

You should have diversified a bit more though, at least three or four similar companies for long term. And instead of 100K on basic interest savings I would have added at least 400K given market is a bit risky now.

It is ok anyway, for long term. Also it might recover fast if the macro gets better... do not obsess over the numbers. Good thing is you won't waste the money in nonsensical crap that will end up in the landfill, so look, better invested in Intel even if it's down a bit now; I wouldn't sell personally with a huge loss like that unless you are completely certain you can make more money with the 400K-500K that remain (opportunity cost).

It might continue to go down or up, I would not obsess with it. Long term Intel is a solid purchase, I don't think you will have to wait a decade to recover the initial amount not even close.

There are dividends too.",2
361,lgd2x6s,1722722155,FoxTheory,"""The wrong time to buy intel"" that's subjective. Most people here think you picked the perfect time to buy intel. These memes wouldn't exist if you didn't lose 250k in less than 8 hours.  

Some advice: it's never too late to sell a bad investment, and it's never too late to buy a good one. 20% isn't that bad; you can recover from that hit. 

I'm all for people who don't diversify if they know what they are doing. Countless no-brainer undervalued stocks come to light, or overreaction to news intel isn't one of them. Intel is a gamble. It could pay off, but it could not. It's not something you put 100% of your money into. If you believe in it, leave some money there. 

Why didn't you buy protective puts with that much money on the line? It's because you don't know what you're doing, and that's fine. Everyone starts somewhere, and we all lose money. It's the cost of learning and investing is essential.

I suggest taking some introductory investing courses until you learn the basics. Until then, you should stick to buying ETFs. I can guarantee you will make your money back in the S&P (I wouldn't purchase Spy right now). 20% isn't that bad.",2

771,lg7fj9u,1722634287,mr-louzhu,"Bud, when investing, you don't bet the house on a single race horse. This isn't how you generate returns or grow wealth. Especially if that race horse is ailing and has already been on the backfoot for years. It's always possible Intel turns this around in 15-20 years but that's a big maybe. For all we know, Intel's stock could deflate even further. I mean I'm talking down to potentially the single digits, or at least low double digits. You might be looking at not just losing 30% of your inheritance but 90%, without any guarantee that it will ever recover by the time you reach retirement age or otherwise need to cash in on it. So what you're doing is the the definition of foolish.

I don't have a crystal ball. I'm just saying the type of unnecessary risk you've exposed yourself to here, especially with Intel of all companies. And for all we know, in 20 years the tech sector might not even exist in its current form due to wider global trends.

If you're going to be investing almost a million dollars without doing any real due diligence, I'm no money manager but I think you are doing it wrong.

This is 100% sunk cost fallacy thinking, man. I know Warren Buffet has said things to the effect of being patient but there's being patient, and then there's just making unsound financial decisions.

It's not actually too late to back out. If you take that money out of Intel and diversify, in 20 years you'll have a very nice nest egg. Right now what you're doing is the equivalent of playing Roulette with your inheritance, with the odds stacked against your favour.

Also, do yourself a favour and hire a money manager.",1

This month was awful for them, and there was several bellwethers to look for in the industry.

Next time, donâ€™t buy something all at once, spread them out in 50-100k increments, on set schedules. And also, if you do buy a HUGE position right before earnings in a downtrendâ€¦HEDGE!!!

He more than anyone knew because he was a jewish kid who escaped out of Hungary in the 1930s. Long story short, Intel forgot to be paranoid. They grew fat and lazy on their pc monopoly. Then smartphones happened and Paul Otellini went directly against the wisdom of Intel cofounder Bob Noyce when he decided against manufacturing chips for the iPhone because there was 'no money in it'. He forgot that his predecessor Bob Noyce had once bet the company on their ability to decrease the marginal costs of chips initially priced at a loss. They managed and established a monopoly for pc cpu's. Now the world has moved on from Intel not just in smartphone chips but in GPUs especially, and on top of that more big tech firms are designing their own chips for AI and other applications. Qualcomm is even trying to establish a new CPU competitor in their PC business. So Intel is under attack from all sides at once. It's not even a full frontal attack, they're completely surrounded now.

Also, I remember reading your thought process about Intel possibly becoming the next large chip manufacturer and the up and comer if anything happens to NVDA or AMD. 

Considering NVDA has been driving the Ai revolution and has about 80% of the market, edging out the competition, itâ€™s fairly safe to say that you could expect a poor earnings report from Intel, their direct competitor.

Be smart, pull out the remaining money and dump it into the S&P 500 and forget about it till youâ€™re in your mid-late 40s and retire. Bag holding a company that just fired 10,000 employees to reduce costs and just cut their dividends is an incredibly dumb idea.",1
1101,lg7jib5,1722635672,HorseNuts9000,"C'mon man... You're not in any way stuck to Intel. If you sell now, there is no legal problem, no tax problem, no nothing. Every single moment you decide not to sell, you are making an unconscious decision to buy. Would you really spend $500k on Intel now? After seeing what you just saw? A company that announced massive layoffs to cover itself from going under? That sounds like a success story you want to get behind? 

If you want an analogous company, look at Kodak. Absolutely a revolutionary pioneer that once kept an entire city alive with how massive they were. If you asked someone 40 years ago, they'd say ""Invest in Kodak, look how important they are! They're bound to stick around!"" And it wouldn't have been that crazy. But in your situation, you're looking at Kodak after smartphones have been invented and saying ""Yeah, they're due for a comeback. All in on Kodak!""

Pull your money out and invest in an index fund ETF. Put it all on SPY. If it were so easy to beat the market by picking one magic stock, everybody would be doing it. But it isn't, and even professional investors very rarely beat the index funds. 

If you go in on SPY, in 10 years your current $500k will be about $1.4m, assuming 10% annual returns (which is reasonable). If you decide to hold Intel, if you get extraordinarily lucky, you will have $500k in 10 years.",1

Itâ€™s a downward spiral. They wonâ€™t come back until there is competent management and that is hard to change. 

Swallow the pride and sell and cut the losses. You never yolo what you cannot afford to lose. After selling put 90% in long term index mutual funds and only play with 10% or maybe much less to see if you can make some back. If you lose that than just accept that you arenâ€™t as knowledgeable about the market. Stop playing until you learn more. 

Hedge funds have a lot of smart people and high level access to market info and thousands or data points and analytics to decide how and what to do. Even after all that extremely few can beat the index funds in long term returns. It just shows that it isnâ€™t easy.

Sounds like if the stock goes up or down it's not really going to change your life in any way, so just keep that in mind and count your blessings that you can lose a significant amount of money and it's still NDB. 

Maybe you should not give in to the sunk cost fallacy and not continue making stupid decisions with your money though. Is what you are feeling right now not telling you anything about your behavior yesterday? Is it not screaming at you telling you that what you did was stupid and you shouldn't have done it? 

Like if investing $700k on just Intel was a dumb idea yesterday, why is keeping $500k on just Intel today not also a dumb idea?

If your parents had taught you basic financial literacy, at the very least having you understand the value of a dollar if not making you pay for your fair share of the residence at college age, then you absolutely would not be in this situation. The fact that they were not remotely involved with such a large sum of money being immediately distributed to someone that has very little fiscal responsibility is alarming and should be studied in a case on its own. As crazy as it sounds, I really canâ€™t blame you for making the decisions that youâ€™ve made up to this point as all logic would dictate that there was no one around, at least no one in your personal trusted circle, that has the ability to explain the ramifications of this situation. 

For starters, only spending what you can afford to lose is RULE #1 of investing/gambling/or spending in general aside from basic human necessities. 

Rule #2 is to not â€œput all your eggs in one basketâ€.

Much like every other young, dumb kid that has ever been in a remotely similar situation, you have flawlessly managed to do both in one day, and these are the consequences. Trust me, Iâ€™ve been there myself.

-HOWEVER THERE IS A SILVER LINING-

You still have a TON of money. Quite honestly, plenty left to undo whatever decisions you made at some point in the near future and then some. I would seriously recommend eating the loss and using your remaining funds to hire a financial advisor or some legitimate professional to guide you through the next stages of your life. Eat up your debt. Buy a stable house and car that will provide you with long term wealth and the ability to support a family while still saving hundreds of thousands of dollars. 

Even though this is surely traumatic for you, youâ€™ve been gifted a blessing and plenty of opportunity to avoid squandering all of it. I truly hope that you seek help and find someone to assist you with making the responsible decisions that need to be made. 

Godspeed, friend.",1

1306,lg7m5b7,1722636620,MonMonOnTheMove,"When evaluating the decision to buy Intel stock after a price drop, it's essential to look beyond the immediate fluctuations and consider the broader context of the company and its industry. Intel Corporation, a longstanding giant in the semiconductor industry, has faced significant challenges over recent years, but todayâ€™s drop in its stock price could present a buying opportunity for investors willing to take a long-term perspective.

Firstly, Intelâ€™s stock price drop could be a result of short-term market volatility or reaction to specific news that doesnâ€™t necessarily reflect the company's fundamental value. Often, stock prices can be influenced by broader market trends, investor sentiment, or transient issues that may not impact the company's long-term prospects. For instance, if the drop is due to temporary supply chain issues or macroeconomic factors, these may resolve over time, potentially leading to a rebound in the stockâ€™s value.

Intel is at a critical juncture in its strategy and technological evolution. The company has been aggressively investing in next-generation technologies and infrastructure to regain its competitive edge. With substantial investments in manufacturing facilities, such as its new semiconductor fabs in the United States and Europe, Intel aims to increase its production capabilities and reduce reliance on external foundries. This expansion aligns with global trends towards supply chain diversification and onshoring critical technologies, potentially enhancing Intelâ€™s market position.

Moreover, Intel's strategic shift towards advanced technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing, and 5G could drive future growth. The company has been developing new products in these areas, positioning itself to capitalize on the increasing demand for high-performance computing solutions. For example, Intelâ€™s advancements in AI chips and its focus on innovation in data center technologies could lead to substantial revenue growth as these markets expand.

Another factor to consider is Intelâ€™s strong balance sheet and significant cash reserves. A healthy financial position provides Intel with the flexibility to invest in research and development, weather economic downturns, and potentially buy back stock or pay dividends. These factors contribute to the company's resilience and ability to execute its strategic plans effectively.

Furthermore, Intel has a history of recovering from challenging periods. While the company has faced competitive pressure from rivals like AMD and Nvidia, it has demonstrated an ability to adapt and innovate over time. The drop in stock price might present a buying opportunity for those who believe in Intelâ€™s capacity to navigate its current challenges and capitalize on future growth opportunities.

Itâ€™s also important to consider the broader semiconductor industry trends. The demand for semiconductors continues to rise across various sectors, including consumer electronics, automotive, and industrial applications. As a key player in this space, Intel is well-positioned to benefit from the overall industry growth, provided it can execute its strategy effectively.

In conclusion, while todayâ€™s stock price drop might raise concerns, itâ€™s crucial to assess Intelâ€™s long-term potential and strategic positioning. The companyâ€™s investments in technology, strong financial health, and strategic focus on emerging markets could provide substantial upside for long-term investors. As with any investment decision, itâ€™s wise to conduct thorough research, consider your investment horizon, and consult with a financial advisor to ensure that buying Intel stock aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance.",1

You need to understand why they ending up here.

They spend 10 years just to back to where they were.

Is it possible for it to go back to $50? Sure, but even if it does it only double your investment, I said only because the risk you taking here is overwhelmingly bigger than your reward.

You are taking a 350k gain vs a 700k lost bet and its more likely to end up with 700k lost than a 350k gain.

You are gambling and you are bad at it.

You are bad at calculate the potential gain vs potential lost, you are also bad at understand the chances for which way it more than likely to happens.

Lastly, you are completely underestimate how long 10 year is.

We can barely see what happen 6 month later yet you somehow see a 10 year comeback with double of your investment. And even so it is still a very bad bet because in comparison SPY can do better with much much lower risk.

BTW, for the future reference, you never EVER buy a stock that used to pay dividend but end up not paying, it's a massive red flag shows that they are VERY thin on cash, a company will NEVER just cancel its dividend payout, it's a last resort to keep as much cash as possible. It is VERY VERY bad for a dividend company to do that.

Another example is Boeing. They cancel dividend ever since covid and it's been 5 years now, half of decade it still hang around at the lower end from 2020.",1

What does that course teach you fundamentally? That statements involving properties of the reals and functions on them can be proven rigorously from a set of axioms. Does one assume anything when constructing these proofs? No, you build from the fundamentals, the triangle inequality, the definitions of limits, definitions of convergence, Cauchy criteria etc. 

Now imagine someone who has the ability to prove theorems in analysis, do you think they are emotional and deny the evidence in front of them to construct a false proof? No way right? They look at all the axioms and previously proved theorems to construct a new proof. If their original attempt was wrong, they go back and rectify, they leave ego at the door because correctness is supreme. 

You are literally doing the opposite, and you know this. You know someone with that mindset would have looked at the company that gave away the biggest lead in tech possibly ever, has faulty chips, and is now laying off 15k and suspending dividends and riddled in debt as a bad investment, and should they have made the error of buying they would sell at a loss and move on in life.

Expect a decline in market share for x86 processors, while this shrinking market share is further split between Intel and AMD.

4. Intels fabs are no longer competitive with TSMC fabs when it comes to leading edge process nodes - in fact, Intel has begun to switch their latest high-end processors to TSMC fabs, which will cut into Intel's profit margins and thus, presumably, also put downward pressure on the stock price.",1

You want to get 10 year treasury bonds they are at 4.5% interest right now. At the End of those 10 years you will even have some profit.

So here it is - letâ€™s start with telling you that I have been successful swing trader on blue chips. Things I look for as a red flag - A company sitting at all time low ( ipo must be 5 years old. No bio pharma ). When a sector is up but one particular company stock is not going up or not going up as much as it supposed to ( bad price action). A company as old as stock market is. These kind of companies tend to go down forever once they hit all time low on a large scale. INTEL meets all these criteria. If I was in your shoes I would take loss on 70% of the position today and put stop loss 10% below. No matter what stock does after I sell my position. After that I will be looking to put money in spy once it enters in correction territory. Spy will give dividends and 5-10% average yearly return in 10 years time frame. If you compound that. You will end up recovering your 30% loss and 30% extra. My suggestion is not a financial advice. Market runs on math and odds. Odds are against INTEL and math is in favor of SPY.  u/Sad_Nefariousness10,1

Youâ€™re still being dumb. Spend a few hundred and talk to a financial adviser. Tell your parents youâ€™re a moron. Take a professionalâ€™s advice on what to do.

If youâ€™re too scared to tell anyone, for your own sake, just wait a few months and hope for a minor correction, sell, and buy an index fund and try not to think about it anymore.

At worst they will have to replace the broken cpus for their biggest customers which frankly are huge datacenters who buy thousands of these at a time. If they had to for instance replace all the broken cpus for their biggest client it would cost around 6bn. Considering they just anounced the cost cutting they are probably expecting that they will have to replace the cpus atleast for the data centers. If they also have to make regular customers whole its gonna cost them extra. Let alone the negative impact this will have on future orders. Id really suggest thinking again about holding for a decade. Look into the issues with the 13th/14th gen chips look up the failure rates for data centers.

Remember sunk cost fallacy though. There is literally zero reason to hold Intel expecting it to rebound in 10years as it may not. Just because this is the company you lost the money in.

The only real question you need to ask yourself now is. Where is the best place to put my money now to make it back.

If I were you (not financial advice). I'd take the money out and just see how this ""recession/correction"" plays out. Imo you'd be better off praying we hit a major downturn and then throwing what you have left in after the market has taken a hit. Hell, even go 3x if you feel confident shit is going to rebound.

Imo you got a lot better chance over 10 years just being in the general market than a single stock. Fucking QQQ is down 10% already. If it hits 20% off highs I'd just pile back in and wait it out there. Or like I said. Go hard into TQQQ if you wanna play risky.Â

  This stock can go way further low, the economy as a whole can go way further down and get into a bear market that can last 10 yearsâ€¦no body know! 
  What I know for sure is that you still have a large capital to invest even after your loses. Exit your position, and donâ€™t touch this money. Get yourself a real trading education, paper trade till you learn the ins and outs of market. And when you ready to trade, your capital will be there and youâ€™ll make this money all back at no time. 
  Market psychology, be humble and accept you fucked up and exit the position while you still have capital left!  Take it as school tuition and learn from it.

You haven't lost anything, you're down, that's all. If you sell your position, then you've realized a loss. I know you're a young guy, so understanding what I'm saying might be difficult. Another tip would be to look at an andex chart. It shows the investment of $100 from January 1st 1950 to December 31st 2023. The $100 grew to $353,000. A little unrealistic right now, but we've gone through countless market corrections, recessions, etc and the return is still outstanding. I know it's hard to be positive right now, but if the stock comes back and grows 10% this year, dis you lose 1/3 of your investment or did you make 10%? Keep your cool and stop looking at this daily. In 2014 it was trading at $20 a share, and in January of this year it was trading at $48. Right now it's correcting. It'll come back, the company is worth more than 50 billion and has been around since the 60's. It's not going anywhere, and neither is your money, so just relax.",1

Sadly, nobody knows. One can only say that over the last couple decades since the tech boom INTC has consistently under-performed the major index funds.

Given the size of the red candle this month, it's hard to imagine it won't bounce back some in the next few weeks to months. But, take this as a lesson in investing. You got greedy and thought you were smart. You may be smart, but most the people making big bucks on Reddit literally got lucky and there are several losers for every one winner, almost none of who won by virtue of their investing skill. Extremely few people are both resources well enough and smart enough to beat the market. I cannot over-emphasize how many people you see making big money trading or picking stocks did so by virtue of their luck, and I cannot over-emphasize how many more people there are who went broke trying to replicate the luck of others. 

Even considering your loss, you're still wayyyyyyyyyy ahead of most of us by inheriting such a large sum of money.

You'll get many different opinions on this, but personally if I were in your shoes I'd hold on for a bounce in the near term, and on the bounce I'd move my money into SPX or some other index fund. And, I'd probably buy a few BTC and some ETH. Perhaps a couple investment properties in states with laws friendly to the landlord. Then I""d just sit back and put any free income into my 401k, IRA, etc. and prepare to retire early.",1

In the early days of colonialism, investors from Holland would buy boats and send them off on missions to South-East Asia to purchase spices and bring them back to Europe where the spice could be resold for a huge profit.  However, sending ships that far in that time period was dangerous, and sometimes the ship would sink, causing the investor to lose everything.

Eventually the investors of Holland got together and got smart.  What if, instead of 10 investors owning one boat each, decided to pool their resources together, and each of them now owned 10% of ten boats?  Then if one boat sank, they were not completely screwed, and they would still get 10% of the profits from ten different boats.

And that was how the world's first stock exchange was founded.

you're mistake wasn't buying intel or the timing. it was putting it all down on one stock instead of reducing your risk for free thru diversification. and now I think you may be making another mistake, just as large, by automatically assuming you need to (or should) hold for 10 years (and in one stock).",1
2791,lg8csub,1722646813,YamFine4702,"So I have a pretty simple suggestion that should provide a modest but reliable weekly return. You should sell covered calls against your long position, this would be 229 contracts. You would sell contracts every Friday with an expiration on the following Friday.  You'd want to sell contracts with at least a 10% breakeven point to reduce the risk of being assigned.  I'll give you a current example. If you sold 229 $24 calls for next Friday @$0.15 you'd collect $3,443.00 in premiums, you could go further out to the $26 calls @$0.05 and collect $1151.00 in premiums ( this is 20% breakeven). You could do this every week and collect somewhere between ~$50-$100K a year in premiums. You could use those funds to double down and buy more shares to reduce your cost or maybe use it to diversify. Either way it's a good option to provide a consistent hedge on this investment for the long term.",1

To me the drop seems like an overreaction by the market mainly from the ceasing of dividends and job cuts. Investors get spooked when they see this but these are cost saving measures that should improve efficiency and profitability in the long term. When Meta cut jobs their stock prices also dipped, then they hit ATH the following year. I used to work in a company that went in the red at -$40m profits per year, and then swing back to +$400m the following year after job cuts and restructuring.",1

2809,lg8d7cr,1722646971,cdg,"I feel bad that it worked out this way for you OP, but please take this as a learning opportunity. The primary mistake that you made wasn't your conviction in Intel stock, it was the way you went about building your position.

It sounds like you bought $700k all at once, which might not be a big deal for a hedge fund, but it definitely is for a teenager.

It may have felt like the right thing to do at the time, but you took on a ton of risk nnecessarily. If your goal were to try to get a 10% pop in the next 2 weeks and then sell out (generally not a good idea but some highly regarded daytraders do this) then you should have bought the stock and put in a stop loss of let's say 5%.

If your time window for Intel is 5, 10 years or more, there's not really a rush to buy it. What you should have done is dollar cost averaged (DCA) your way into the stock. As an example, you could buy $50k of Intel each week for the next 14 weeks, or at the very least bought $100k each week for 7 weeks. One rule I have is ""don't do it all at once"", which somtimes means when I'm about to pull the trigger, at minimum, I split a trade into 2 halves for this exact reason.

Another way to look at this is that you've inherited at least half a million dollars, which is vastly more than most people. I'm a millionaire, but I started from $0 and don't expect to ever receive any sort of inheritance when my parent's die. You could cash out some portion of your investment in the coming weeks / months and put it into something more diversified such as SPY, QQQ, treasury bonds, etc.

If they ask just say chuckle and say something like well you can't time the market. Delete the app, forget about it, check it as little as possible. INTC will not go bankrupt but they are a dogshit company. It's unfortunate you went all in because now you are stuck, but you do have options (no not those). I would wait for a better exit out of INTC, it will probably rebound and retest a few historical resistances. Do your research, find out what these are and set price notifications for them. Then ask yourself if you really think INTC is the best place to park that money. Just holding your bags is still a massive L because of missed out gains you could make by investing that 500k elsewhere, and even then you're depending on a prayer that this dogshit company gets bailed out. Assuming INTC has some rebound, stomach the loss and park that money in VOO or a money market fund

Intel FAILED at 10nm and needed TSM to help them catch up (still behind) to 5nm.

It was a company that failed to innovate, lost market share hand over fist and now need government funding to stay relevant. The report put that in jeopardy fundamentally given not only their losses, but the job cuts. Funding was based on union mandates creating US jobs.

Citing PE is a horrible approach. Paying a little more for growth and exploding revenues using PEG and forward PE is what you want to look for.

The doctom boom promptly went bust a few months later and Apple crashed by something like 66% in a week.  This was followed by further losses in the post-9/11 recession.  I kept holding my shares through the invention of the iPod and the iPhone, the Great Recession, and eventually got to see Apple's stock skyrocket in 2010-2011 as people finally realized that the company was making a fortune selling devices that are arguably more addictive than heroin.  When I sold my shares after holding them for 12 years, my $2,000 investment had turned into enough money to buy a house.  Keep holding on, and you'll find yourself in the same situation someday.

Putting everything one card is always gambling. No matter with how much points you come up to convince yourself you never know!

Next rule never buy all at once. Especially not such a high amount. Cost average price is what you aiming for. When you want to invest 10k long term for example. Monitor the charts look for a good entry point and split your 10k in to 5 x 2k positions over some weeks/months.

To be honest it might take some time but you might recover from your current loss. I would strongly recommend to get out as soon as you break even. Then start with a much much smaller amount or if you don't want to get into investing, look out for ETF or a dividend portfolio. Even the worst investment company would have give you a better advice then putting the whole 700k all at once in one stock.

Good luck.

I'm curious - why *now* for Intel? Even before the terrible (but not unexpected) earnings report, and the massive layoffs and restructuring, this company has had major problems. For one thing, it appears *every processor they've produced in the last 2 years may be completely fucked*, and an unprecedented recall and/or class action lawsuit is on the horizon, it might just break the company. Even if the company does survive this more or less intact, Intel isn't the monopoly it used to be, AMD is making a better, cheaper product and eating more of Intel's lunch every year.

However do a little research next time and first rule of fight club is why would someone buy stock in a company right before earnings? Much less why would anyone invest in intel? Even if someone plans on holding the stock for 10 years, intel been a shit company for the past 20+ years and their stock has been stagnant during that time with average range of $25-$35 after hitting their ATH of like $64 in 2000. Pretty sure a HYSA would net more profits in the next decade than intel. 

Anyway, on the bright side for OP, at least he got in at $30 vs say $40-$45 earlier this year cuz there was false hope intel had their shit together. Course the government giving them $8.5b to drive their stock price up helped.

It's highly possible that this story will find it's way back to your parents so my advice is take a few days but tell them first. Cringe media outlets love this kind of content.

If you're holding for 10 years your loss is only on paper. You still have the same number of shares you bought.

Intel's slow death has been a long time coming, a long time coming. It's not just this recent issue. 

The only thing that would have saved them is a step change to ARM technology. And we've all been waiting to hear if that's what they are going to announce. So sad to hear that they didn't announce it. Either that or lower power consumption for better battery life for their own technology, and we've been waiting too long, far too long, and their battery life has not improved to the level that ARM can perform at.

They're acting like an angry old man who doesn't want to adapt. 

To top it off, they invested heavily in a country, Israel, that is not only politically volatile, but militarily volatile.  This is not what you do If you want to run a successful business at low risk. Investing in Israel has been heavily damaging to their bottom line and their reputation in terms of being good decision makers. It's why companies all around the world invest in India for their call centers instead of Pakistan, because Pakistan is a volatile country with a high degree of civil disobedience and strikes.

Therefore, the decision to invest in a country like Israel is seen by investors as an emotional decision rather than a logical one.

It's one thing to invest in Israeli services because services can be swapped and changed to a different region quite easily, but they invested in infrastructure and fabrication, and that's something that you can't easily walk away from if the region becomes volatile, and the workers at the fabrication plants are literally in fear for their lives so they can't come to work.

Bottom line is don't invest in a country where a worker, as part of their orientation tour when joining a company, needs to be informed where the bunkers are in case there's an attack. I'm not trying to diss Israel. It's just the reality of the game of making money.

And to top it all off, the new version of Windows for ARM runs really, really well, as in, it shocked everyone in the tech sector and  exceeded everybody's expectations. The only other shock after this has been why there aren't any Intel ARM chips when it's quite obvious that Microsoft has been working on improving Windows on ARM for a really, really long time.

Sorry to put the knife into Intel, but here's the twist of the knife that again nobody expected. There is absolutely zero effort required to make your apps run on ARM. All you need to do is recompile it. That's how easy Microsoft has made it. 

Sigh. I remember reading Andy Grove's biography a couple of decades ago, or maybe autobiography, I can't remember. He was Intel employee #3 and was one of those people who had an impact into the way I work and the way I do business. I didn't always agree with the way he did things, but he certainly was an inspiration in some small way.

For one, Intel has been in the hot seat for years due to ongoing issues with their chips for the better part of a decade, and there was no news to suggest it was about to get better. 

Two, you can change your plan any time. Its a common fallacy that people feel locked in when their initial judgement proves wrong. You can just as easily exit, do better research and try a different, better plan. Absolutely nothing locks you into this move and eventually regaining your position over years is not ""recovery"".

Three, the opposite is also true. Intel's market value could bounce back quickly for any number of reasons. 

Four, every successful investor ever will tell you not to invest all in one. It's a stupid idea that will expose you to a MASSIVE risk of losing it all. What are you going to do if Intel actually fails? My best friend was riding high YOLO-ing with Tesla last year and I kept telling him it was idiotic. He turned 20k into 250k. Then, his luck changed a little, and he took 3 L's in a row, lost the *entire pie.* Not kidding, he lost the whole account, 100%.

Part of my investments are in Intel, too. But I didn't lose over 30% of the whole account over it. I'm not stressing at all, not one bit.

I'm gonna be honest, I think you should play with a smaller fraction of your money for a few years. Learn how to stay alive in this game before exposing your entire net worth to it again. Also, maybe just confess to your parents. They're probably thinking you get in bad with a mafia hitman or something if you start getting visibly secretive and scared.",1

Here's the thing: Every two years on average, the market enters into correction. Every six years on average, the market enters into recession. If you have cash, what would have been wiser, would have been to wait for the markets to enter into either correction or recession, then go all in on intel. Wait for it to go on sale.

While many mock you, make fun of your short term drop... If you zoom out... Intel was at $50 December 2023. At $30/share, you are getting a roughly 40% discount from those highs. Sure, right now it is at a $21/share price point. But I'd argue that while waiting a day or two could have made that 40% discount a 60% discount, you still made a valid investment.

You bought in at lows comparable to 2014. It is now at lows comparable to 2011.

Here's the million dollar question: Do you think Intel is going bankrupt? Are they a profitable company?

I think if you hold, you'll be fine. Ideally, as the stock goes up and back to $50 you have a couple of choices. You can sell, or you can borrow against your assets. You'll pay interest, but ultimately you never pay back that loan and die with it unpaid.

Stocks go up and down. Just when you think it can't drop more, it does.

I do think you can expect the market to crash in the near future. Don't sell, just hold, and when the market rebounds, it'll have more value than it does now.",1

Are you a professional investor?  Did you study finance, economics, and all of the mathematics that goes into it?  Did you spend 4+ years studying that?  Have you now found employment at a big firm like Morgan Stanley or Charles Schwab where you are now a certified financial advisor?

No? SO HIRE ONE.  My parents recently came into a lot of money via an inheritance as well and stuck with the financial advisor that originally did all of it for one of my grandparents, and they have not lost 1/3 of that money picking a single beyond risky stock...

HIRE SOMEONE THAT DOES THIS FOR A LIVING!

OR STUDY STATISTICS, ECONOMICS, FINANCE, AND DO YOUR DUE DILLIGENCE IN INVESTIGATING A STOCK TO INVEST IN.

I'd go with the professional certified financial advisor who has a proven track record of MAKING PEOPLE MONEY, vs doing it yourself and losing (what seems to be) over $200,000 in a short time frame.

Or don't do either, and keep doing what you've been doing.

By the way: holding for a decade with this stock?  Why is that your ONLY CHOICE?  I predict you not doing well over 10 years if you decide to do that.

I myself haven't bought any Intel because I have a background and degree in tech and am ACUTELY AWARE of what the future of that company looks like.  And it's not great.  In fact before the first Ryzen chips came out I bought a bunch of AMD stock and made a ton of money.  Since the first generation Ryzen chips Intel's stock has been falling steadily, they haven't paid dividends, and the company has unfinished billion dollar foundaries that are already 1-2 generations behind TSMC.  This is not the stock to bet 10 years on, as they're years away from even being able to manufacturer chips at the NM level their unfinished foundaries aimed for, let alone the 2-4nm TSMC is doing.

If you didn't understand all of that last paragraph it means you know nothing about the company, the landscape it occupies, and should not be touching any stock that's remotely related to technology because you clearly bet on the wrong dog in this one.

If I were you, and I'm NOT A CERTIFIED FINANCIAL ADVISOR?  I'd sell ALL OF THAT INTEL STOCK and trade it for AMD stock.  AMD stock is going to keep going up and up and up as more and more server and ML farms replace the buggy, antiquated, terrible Intel chips with AMD chips.  AMD already has their chips in 2 of the 3 ""big 3"" video game consoles, their CPUs are second to none, and while their GPUs are nowhere near NVIDIA's in terms of AI/ML and the CUDA architecture, they do sell well for people who just what a GPU to play video games and not create a CNN based on terrabytes of data.

So yeah.  You lost 200k in how short a window?  Time to hire a certified financial advisor with fiduciary responsibility. And I PERSONALLY WOULD sell it for AMD stock ASAP (this is NOT financial advice).",1

You have to understand something very fundamental here: you have not lost any money at all. Itâ€™s all there in the % of Intel (as part of the company) and also itâ€™s very likely you will at least go back to 0% loss over 20 years max-ish. 

Take the stress out of your life; donâ€™t watch this every day. Bury it and look at it in 2-3 years again.

At the moment you are suffering from sunk cost fallacy but what you really need to be thinking about is opportunity cost. The 500k value that you still have in a stock which has fallen out of favour and could still sink further in the near future could be better put to work in a 'boring' investment like a global ETF.

Yeah you could wait for 10 years for it to recover but you might have been in the same or better position in 10 years by investing 500k in a less risky investment. You only need a 3.4% annual return on 500k to get back to 700k in 10 years which you can do with much less risk if that is plan.  Sell it on Monday and at least you still have 500k. Yeah you blew 200k in a dumb way but shit happens, just got to move on from it and take it as a learning lesson. Investors clearly didn't like what they heard in the the recent Intel statement so who knows, you could be down another 50k by the end of the week if you continue to hold.

tldr:

1. Leaving it in a single volatile stock with poor near-term prospects and no dividend for 10 years is not a sound investment strategy. 

2. Sell Intel on Monday and dump it into a 'boring' investment and forget about it. Check your investment value once a month at most.

Second, why on earth Intel? Without even looking at anything, their long-term prospects are awful: the desktop PC market is dying, Apple is using ARM, Microsoft is turning to ARM. The server market is the cloud. Every cloud vendor wants to make (or already makes) its own CPUs. The embedded market is Armel, ARM, RPi.  Nothing to see there. In graphic cards, they had their ass handled by Nvidia big time. And the growth is gonna be AI, where Nvidia reigns is uncontested.

Itâ€™s not too late. Yes, youâ€™ve lost an enormous amount of money that I donâ€™t think at your age you really have a strong concept of. Maybe next time you decide to invest large sums and donâ€™t have a strong understandingâ€¦. Hire an accountant or a fiduciary.Â 

I guess the main thing Iâ€™m concerned about for you â€” at this point â€” is that Intel isnâ€™t a strong company with a bright future. Youâ€™re either going to come out of this looking like a genius, or a complete idiot. Thatâ€™s not usually how Iâ€™d want to invest my entire net worth. A key thing to keep in mind is relative performance. Maybe Intel doesnâ€™t eat it entirely over the next decade. Heck, they may grow at a 4% YoY rate. That still makes them a bad investment, because the market will grow at ~8.5% net of taxes and fees. The delta between 4% and 8.5% is massive. $500k at 8.5% over ten years isâ€¦ $1,169,707.67 NET OF TAXES AND FEES. $500k at 4% over ten years is $745,896 before taxes â€” which would subtract about $86,000 from that value.Â

You're only punishing yourself by staying with INTC.

With no dividend and no share growth you'll have to hold this forever.   You cannot guarantee the company's 
success.


Here's the simplest way to fix a fixable mistake.

1) Sell 100% INTC

2) Buy SPLG (S&P 500 Index) with 100% of your proceeds. 

3) DRIP your dividends (currently ~.21 per share per qtr) and add ~50 to 100 shares of SPLG per year

Certainly having a single stock is not safe unless you are very clear on future profits and margin of safety.

I had no idea what I was doing but I was making money. I was swing trading Tesla, Nike, Nvidia, AMD, and whatever else was volatile at the time. 

Then one day I saw a stock on my watchlist drop. GE. I decided right then and there I was gonna make the biggest move Iâ€™d ever done. I sold half my stocks over the course of a few weeks and kept doubling down on â€œthe bottom of GEâ€ the bottom was no where in site it just kept falling. I donâ€™t remember the details but I was down 2-3k. I closed my robinhood app and didnâ€™t open it for for months at a time. 

Today I can say that i finally broke even and then some.

Will those stocks drop further? Maybe. I think we could be heading into a potential correction even further than what we have had thus far.

But a good trader admits when he is wrong and you my friend just lost 200k your grandma left you

I think you owe it to her to salvage whatâ€™s left and maybe take a better approach

Learn risk management buddy, you clearly have the wrong idea of how to trade

4833,lgd2ovj,1722722068,Bob54386,"Man, I don't think Intel has gotten anything right since \~the Core Duo release.  They used to be at the forefront of cutting-edge small feature fabrication but they screwed up the release of that for YEARS and lost the market lead.  Their executives aren't great at delivering on the projects you're hyped up about, they are professional salesman, not professional leaders.  You're getting suckered by the pitch.

Your thesis is more or less ""Oh, this chart seems to be a lot lower than the rest of the semiconductor market.""  The rest of the semis all have good bull cases they are delivering on.  Intel's lower because they haven't delivered on a project for a decade, they lost their CPU dominance to AMD and are more or less an afterthought now.

Don't fall for the sunk cost fallacy.  Even if you somehow have better business sense than the entire semiconductor industry & investors this position is going to be emotional hell to hold for a decade, and it's going to take years off your life in stress.  You do have an option that isn't holding -- cut your losses and regroup.  

Dollar cost averaging down into a SP500 ETF is great.  Going into long term treasuries is great -- tax advantaged, rates are higher than they've been forever, and once rate cuts start (expected to be soon), you can realize some quicker returns if you want to reposition.

Right now you're just experimenting with stock picking.  Doesn't matter what industry / profession you're looking at (science / art / business), the only way to stay afloat is to keep experiments small & replaceable until they've demonstrated success.",1

Advice for you which it seems you already have is to hold until you have most of your capital back, sell all that shit then either hire a qualified fiduciary to handle it OR if just throw it all into an index fund and ignore it.

> â€œSimply put, we must align our cost structure with our new operating model and fundamentally change the way we operate. Our revenues have not grown as expected â€“ and weâ€™ve yet to fully benefit from powerful trends, like AI. Our costs are too high, our margins are too low. We need bolder actions to address both â€“ particularly given our financial results and outlook for the second half of 2024, which is tougher than previously expected,â€ he said.

> The $1.6 billion loss reported by Intel substantially overshadows the $437 million loss Intel posted in the previous quarter. Intel Foundry, which reported a $2.5bn operating loss during the first quarter of 2024, lost an additional $2.8bn in Q2, although the business unit did see a year-on-year (YoY) revenue increase of four percent.

Source: data center dynamics

The good news is, Intel has an opportunity to leverage the US CHIPS and Science Act of 2022.

> The CHIPS and Science Act provides $52.7 billion for American semiconductor research, development, manufacturing, and workforce development. This includes $39 billion in manufacturing incentives, including $2 billion for the legacy chips used in automobiles and defense systems, $13.2 billion in R&D and workforce development,and $500 million to provide for international information communications technology security and semiconductor supply chain activities. It also provides a 25 percent investment tax credit for capital expenses for manufacturing of semiconductors and related equipment. These incentives will secure domestic supply, create tens of thousands of good-paying, union construction jobs and thousands more high-skilled manufacturing jobs, and catalyze hundreds of billions more in private investment.

> The bill requires recipients to demonstrate significant worker and community investments, including opportunities for small businesses and disadvantaged communities, ensuring semiconductor incentives support equitable economic growth and development.

In reality at any point in the future, as soon as Intel is near or slightly above your $30 you are going to sell it and take this as a lesson in diversifying. Some examples. You bought Intel a decade ago - today it would be the same. You bought AMD in '14 for $2 - today it'd be worth..well see yourself. You bought Intel in the middle of the 2009 financial crisis for under 10 bucks - only five years later it'd haveÂ doubled. What I've learned in 30 plus years trading is this: buy when all hope is lost on markets. And the whole system is questioned. Or something big is blown up or huge bombs drop someplace in the world. Yes, it's true what you see with the Intel stock is the future, because nobody seems to expect them to recover anytime soon. On the other hand, without Ryzen (and Jim Keller) in 2017,Â  AMD would not exist today. But with Intel there are many more fields than just CPUsÂ where they goofed. GPU, AI..and It shouldn't be Apple who make the fastest and most efficient processors today. Hope they survive, competition is irreplaceable.",1

2. Again you are doing a mistake. You are justifying your purchase by holding it for a decade. You don't hold a stock because you did a mistae. You hold an investment if fundamentals of the companies are good and there is growth expected in future. If Intel don't grow then you may have to cut off the affected limb so be mindful of that. There is nothing wrong in taking a loss. Just keep watching 1-20quarter earnings and take an informed decision on whether to keep holding the stock or to exit and move to a company with better fundamentals.

Based on the RSI trends on the weekly chart, Intel is THIS close to crossing over into bullishness. From there, it should have a nice long term uptrend over the next year or so unless something drastic happens.

Some other things to keep in mind (which I'm sure you know). They just made the biggest investments in their history to upgrade capabilities which was a big reason for their profitability drop. Plus, any tension in Taiwan would be a positive for Intel since it would basically force NVDA and AMD to work with them.

Your investment will be at least $55 in the next year. Book it. Then just sell half and find the next deep value play for the next year. Do that for the next 5 years and you'll never have to work a day in your life.",0

5707,lg812w2,1722642224,EggieBeans,"u/Sad_Nefariousness10  yo man ik how u feel, like really a huge majority of people in WSB know this feeling, you do all this hard research on a stock, you think youâ€™ve picked the perfect time and everything seems aligned that youâ€™ve got the perfect plan but then it all seems to fall apart even when it felt like it shouldnâ€™t. Meta earnings last quarter I was certain it was going up on a clear beat - they did beat but stock still went down over some bullshit. 

People will tell you to sell intel and others will tell you to hold. Whatever you decide is besides the point, in my opinion you should take out atleast a grand and dedicate that to your grandma as itâ€™s the least you can do, visit her grave and put her favourite flowers on it. Do things that would make her feel proud she worked so hard for you. (And Iâ€™ll tell you now part of what will make her proud is you not being stressed, prioritising your health and spending her money for you to be happy) fuck it if it was me Iâ€™d even find out the people who my gran cared about most and treat them each with a 1k holiday. The feeling youâ€™ll get from that is much more than if youâ€™d made $200k on options TRUST ME. Imagine for example some sweet minimum wage carer who treated ur gran amazingly got a $1k holiday, theyâ€™d break down in tearsâ€¦  

Also $100k in the S&P is honestly a no brainer for ur age come back in 10 years and youâ€™ll be looking very very nice ðŸ‘Œ.

The best thing to do OP is to just accept that the market never wants to work in the direction you want it. 200k gone but 500k is still set for life money seriously. For most people that money is 20 years of hard work so to be sad and stressed over losing 200k when u didnâ€™t even earn it just sounds pathetic (no offence xx)

I heavily advise you to put $250k into an account thatâ€™ll pay you 5.2% APR and do not gamble or invest any of it and try to keep it permanently above 250k. YOU WILL LITERALLY MAKE $1k a month without doing anything!!!!

But yeah maybe ought to re-assess your maths degree ðŸ˜‚ if you canâ€™t even work out how averaging down works (AGAIN NO OFFENCE) but surely you shouldâ€™ve thought maybe I should keep half just in case to bring down my average let  alone do this investment in the first place.

Anyway ðŸ¤ž for you OP u seem like a sweet guy and we all feel horrible when we make dumb decisions like you did, itâ€™s all a learning point and in 10 years this moment will probably be one you are happy happened. I mean seriously man you couldâ€™ve lost all that money but u didnâ€™t. Count yourself fucking lucky",119

5884,lg7hiyy,1722634976,desturel,"You realize people were saying it was dumb before the dip right?  This isn't the case of people crapping on a stock after the fact, people were crapping on the stock before the fact.  The mantra of doing proper due diligence before investing in an asset isn't something that requires you to be a genius.

As far as ""people get quiet when it goes back up"" is true, however how long do you expect that recovery to take? 

To give an example from a similar asset, AMD was \~17 before the 2008 crash.  It took until 2017 for AMD to hit $17 again.  So you had a choice in 2007, you could buy AMD for 17 and hold it for 10 years to break even or you could have cut your losses, bought something else to hold, wait until AMD showed signs of significant recovery, which was 2016 when Ryzen was announced, then bought it and you would have been in a better position.

All most people are advocating for is to not jump into intel while they clearly don't have their stuff together and instead go for a safer investment in the meantime like VTI/SPY.  If you like intel, wait until they clear up their current problems and look like they are recovering. Wait to see how Lunar Lake performs.  Wait until you see an official response to the 13/14th gen issue.  Wait until they actually start producing chips for NVDA from their foundry and have proper sales numbers.

Using your advice a person who bought Rite Aid in 2016 should just ignore all of the warning signs and held on to the stock and assume it would hit its 2000 highs again without any proof.

When you buy an individual company you can't just bury your head in the sand and hope everything comes out roses.  That's irresponsible.  If you don't want to pay attention then don't buy single stocks, but something like VTI, IVV, SPY heck even QQQ.  With an ETF its someone elses job to pay attention to the day to day.  When you own individual stocks, you need to pay attention to the day to day or you are just lighting your money on fire.",11

If the answer is: buy Intel, then he doesn't need to do anything.

Homes are where you invest.  If you're still growing, you're either trying to start a business (so you can get real money) or saving up to purchase a home and then a 2nd home and then a 3rd home.  Homes/apartments give you rent every year and also ""save"" the initial money, AND go up in value.

family bought an apartment for 1.7 million (pesos lol) and it is now worth 10 to 11 million after 20 years.  Lived in it for 15 years.  Now brings in 36k in rent.  
Bought an apartment for 2.7 million and it is now worth 6 million after 5 years. Brings in 25k in rent.

6418,lgdm0hg,1722729371,QuinQuix,"They were doing more than ok 10 years or so ago. At least the business was - revenue and profit were great.

The problem with Intel and the foundry ecosystem is that lead times and capital costs have become so excessive.

20 years ago you had many foundries doing leading edge nodes.

Now you have 3.

And one of them is next to China and the other next to North Korea.

The capital cost + the requirement of having large sales volume to mature nodes (which ensures sufficient profitability) means that you can almost ONLY mature nodes if you're also selling product on the way up.

But you're not going to be selling product if you're not competitive. So it can quickly become a death spiral if you trail too much.

Intel fucked up because they skipped on EUV (which they did because they needed it first but it wasn't ready).

Instead of waiting for EUV to materialize they became masters at multi patterning. But that eventually was the inferior solution. They stuck to it because halfway in switching would've looked terrible on the balance sheet but eventually EUV kept outpacing them and it was just the wrong call.

The second problem was they missed the opportunity to manufacture smartphone chips. 

At the end when EUV became so superior this would have happened anyway because energy efficiency is much better on EUV and this is what smartphones need.

But at the beginning Intel did still have competitive transistors and they just underestimated sales volumes on mobile.

This was particularly terrible because mobile chips are small and are great when you are starting up a new node. Defect rates are still higher but with so many chips on a wafer you're not going to lose as many. That's because the defect rate is absolute (x defects per wafer) while the yield is relative (% of functioning chips). 

This is why apple always leads on a new node. Yes, they have infinite money and they want the best chip first. But nvidia also has crazy amounts of money yet they prefer to wait. That's because you only get 33 nvidia hopper chips out of a wafer and 180 iPhone chips.

30 defects on the wafer may take out a few iPhones, but it will absolutely fuck up the nvidia wafer. So you lead with iPhones because nvidia needs higher yields. And as you make iPhones the defect rate goes down and so on.

By not developing EUV in time and giving away the iPhone Intel allowed tsmc to become a monster and around tsmc 7nm finally found itself in a place where its transistors started lagging the competition with no external customers to properly pay for the investment to keep up with tsmc. 

That's the death spiral.

All of this had happened way way before Pat Gelsinger took over and when it had happened Intel was still making a crazy amount of money because they had no real competition in x86, and in particular no competition for Xeon. But they were already very close to being fucked for good at that point. Their saving grace is their own chips can use their new nodes. But if they trail the competition eventually even this will become too expensive.

In my view Pat Gelsinger is a great CEO and close to a hero because he correctly identified the problem as falling behind too much on the nodes with no potential customers for shitty second best transistors.

He also correctly deduced that the only way out of certain death (ending up with fast depreciating last gen foundries and eventually having to dump foundry) was to accelerate and burn money like no tomorrow. It really is up or out.

And I think few people, even on businesses focused subreddits, appreciate how capital intensive leading edge manufacturing has become. Out means out for good.

China and Russia notably both tried to support leading edge efforts and both failed to maintain chip fabrication at the edge. It is simply too expensive even for countries to just bankroll it - the fabs need selling product to be sustainable throughout its life cycle.

Intel was at the precipice and I believe they're going to make it, but what Pat is doing amounts to pulling up a nosediving airplane trying to make it over a ridge. Yes he's dumping chairs, passengers and all the excess fuel. But Intel will not survive if they can't return to a leadership position in the fab. This is what is necessary.

Of course this is the point where the typical business guy starts suggesting to just dump foundry and become fabless.

But that's an idiotic suggestion that would create almost a monopoly on chip fabrication outside of the west. And as said development lead times and R&D costs are so high in this businesses that it would be an error that quickly becomes impossible to correct.

You can't disband intel the foundry and just rebuild it if you have to. Gone in this case really means gone.

The only example like it I can think of is the drone situation where the US wants to move away from the DJI Mavics but the US no longer has anything remotely competitive in that price bracket. If you want a drone that is good and affordable you need to go to China. And they're miles ahead.

Think that but then a hundred times worse.

Of course - if you're in it to make money and only that - then you can argue that the Intel stock doing better short term is what matters, not the fact that the entire western world would be willfully sticking its head deep in a noose. David Hume once said it is not irrational to prefer the destruction of the universe over tearing your own nail. It's just what matters most to you.

In my view however there was no other option that wouldn't have sold all of us out. This is *absolutely* what needed to be done and Pat is doing it.

If Intel 18A works out and is competitive in performance in price, the good news is there will be a very big incentive for all big chip designers to diversify towards Intel.

I don't think anyone should buy Intel on the hope that Taiwan falls, but companies like Apple and Nvidia would be stupid not to diversify some of their product line away from tsmc. That would drastically reduce both the cost and time (and pain) of making a more substantial shift towards Intel should geopolitical trouble arise. It just doesn't make sense not to do that.

But these companies can't execute any shift until Intel offers an acceptable node. So again it all depends on a return to leadership.

My view is Pat is pulling up the nose of the plane and doing everything he can to scale the ridge ahead. 18A is the light on the other side.  I'm not only in it for the stock. I'm in it because I believe we all need to make it across that ridge. I *truly* believe that.

People who ask why Intel can't go fabless are people asking why the plane we're all in can't just slam into a mountain. It's like asking why the US military can't outsource all of its IT to Iran. The answer is because who wants to live in a world where that happens.

In that world you and everyone around you will be in deep shit eventually.

It's like going  wreck diving and leaving all the extra oxygen behind. Because it is more economical.

It'd also be fucking stupid.

That said, no way in the hell they get back to the good times remotely soon unless they make an AI breakthrough, so the best option is to cut losses and put it in a fund/ETF (preferably more than one), and you'll get that back plus more in a decade and you can just retire on that shit.

Yeah, but zero yield after inflation and taxes.   If inflation is 4%, and yield is 5%, you're taxed on the 5% even though your actual yield is just 1%.   If you pay over 20% tax you're losing money.

There are stocks that die. There are stocks that never recover. Tech world is evolving fast, and something that was part of everyones daily life few years ago, can be completetly forgotten in the future. Nokia for example. There are competitors that want every % of the market. Also AMD is doing pretty well. My Ryzen is going hard for years now.

Points above apply if everything is ok, and you still might lose more money. In 5 years some big global events can happen, than all markets will tank hard, and such stock like Intel can become history.

The guy should sell the shares asap. It will hurt for few days, and then it will be history. Telling that you will forget about it for a decade is obvious lie to your own self just to feel little bit better. In reality you will check that chart every single faking day.

The problem with selling options is that your upside is limited to the value of the contract, and your downside is unlimited if the market goes the other way. Buying contracts is exactly the opposite. ""Option strategies"" combine buying and sometimes selling to try to limit risk, but it's really just gambling as no one knows what the price of intel will be tomorrow let alone in six weeks.

6867,lgdxni9,1722734013,,"Yes, you can write off losses from selling a publicly traded stock on your taxes, and if the loss is large enough, you can carry it forward to future years. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Capital Loss Deduction**: When you sell a stock at a loss, you can use that loss to offset any capital gains you have in the same year. If your capital losses exceed your capital gains, you can use the excess loss to offset up to $3,000 ($1,500 if married filing separately) of other income, such as wages or salary.

2. **Carryover of Losses**: If your capital losses exceed the $3,000 limit, you can carry over the remaining loss to future years. This is known as a capital loss carryover. You can continue to carry forward the loss each year until it is fully used up.

3. **Using Carryover Losses**: In future years, the carried-over loss can first be used to offset any capital gains. If there are no capital gains, or if the carried-over loss exceeds the capital gains, you can again use up to $3,000 ($1,500 if married filing separately) to offset other income.

Here is a simplified example:

- In Year 1, you sell a stock at a loss of $10,000.
- You have no capital gains in Year 1.
- You use $3,000 of the loss to offset other income in Year 1.
- You carry over the remaining $7,000 loss to Year 2.
- In Year 2, you have no capital gains again.
- You use another $3,000 of the loss to offset other income in Year 2.
- You carry over the remaining $4,000 loss to Year 3.

And so on, until the loss is fully used up.

### Important Considerations

- **Wash Sale Rule**: Be aware of the wash sale rule. If you sell a stock at a loss and then repurchase the same or a substantially identical stock within 30 days before or after the sale, the loss is disallowed for tax purposes. Instead, the disallowed loss is added to the cost basis of the repurchased stock.
- **Record Keeping**: Keep detailed records of your transactions, including the dates of purchase and sale, amounts, and the basis of the stocks. This information will be necessary when calculating your gains and losses and when carrying over losses to future years.

For detailed advice tailored to your specific situation, itâ€™s always a good idea to consult a tax professional.",3

Most financial advisers would recommend to use the first year putting the money into a HYSA and change nothing about your lifestyle. Use the time to take stock of your annual expenses, and reassess from there. Oftentimes, it's more financially lucrative to continue renting and invest the money, which would eventually build it into a sizable inflation-beating dividend portfolio that helps out a ton with home costs.",2

This is phenomenally bad timing, but not an unmitigated disaster (say, had he put it all on options or bought some shit company with no long-term outlook).

Edit: perk of selling monthlies vs 1.4 years out is if this gains some steam back upwards, you aren't stuck buying yourself out of those contracts.  Let's say end of August this is at $25, you could close that initial $1.5k and probably sell another batch monthly for $3k at $33-$34.  By September he could be selling calls right at the $31 strike price for $0.60-$0.70 a price, which would be $13k-$15k alone.  If he closes any of these months in the money, he's netted a cool $20k+ in premium, made back all his losses, and exited the position and can diversify this nest egg and put it in a proper ETF.  If this thing hovers at $25-$30 for the next year, he can sell right at his average cost and keep raking in 5-figures until he closes the position itm.  u/Sad_Nefariousness10 just pls do this and end your self-torture.",4

You originally succumbed to optimism bias and Dunning Kruger effect (""I am smarter than average and so will be more successful in picking single stocks than people far more experienced than myself"", with the blind confidence that comes from ""not knowing what you don't know"").

But by now just holding the single stock you are succumbing to sunk cost fallacy, whereby you are staying the course and not acting because you're already in too deep and are trying to avoid your very real losses by not realizing them through a sale. The situation has changed with new information about the company and alsoÂ hopefully some new information to yourself that gambling everything you have on one stock is not investment, it is gambling and not what the money was intended for.

Please, read the Bogleheads forum, educate yourself on long term investment, take the loss, and just put the money into VT (world index fund) and don't look at it again for 20 years. Plenty of people can retire off this amount with this strategy alone.Â  If you feel like you needÂ some more 'play' money to lose, hold 10k of itÂ  to put into individual stocks - ideally transferred to a separate account so it's out of sight and out of mind.",36

* Contamination of chips due to problems of HVAC
* Overvoltage of CPUs causing problem with chips.

Corrosion doesn't occur from over voltage. Contamination does.

  
There is a reason that Fabs have to be cleaner than hospitals and things like HVAC systems which if they fail causes issues. There are rumors that a higher up at Intel was flown in to a fab and to allow for possible contaminated wafers to go forward and made into chips.

Overvoltage is from  that Intel has been going on and on about allowing voltages to go higher and higher with power targets so that they have higher clocks or other parts of the chip and if you had clean wafers that were binned correctly it would be fine.",1
